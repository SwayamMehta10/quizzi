-- FINAL POLICY CONSOLIDATION
-- This script addresses the last 5 multiple permissive policy warnings
-- by consolidating the remaining duplicate policies
--
-- Run this AFTER running both optimize-rls-policies.sql and consolidate-duplicate-policies.sql

-- ===============================================
-- FRIEND_REQUESTS TABLE - FINAL CONSOLIDATION
-- ===============================================

-- The issue: "Users can view friend requests they've received" and "Users can view friend requests they've sent"
-- are two separate policies that together cover all friend request access for a user
-- We can consolidate these into a single policy that covers both cases

-- Drop the individual policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view friend requests they've received" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view friend requests they've sent" ON friend_requests;

-- Create a single consolidated policy that covers both sent and received requests
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their friend requests" ON friend_requests
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (((select auth.uid()) = sender_id) OR ((select auth.uid()) = receiver_id));

-- ===============================================
-- ANSWERS TABLE - CONSOLIDATION WITH LOGIC PRESERVATION
-- ===============================================

-- The issue: "Users can read their own answers" and "Challenge participants can see all answers in their challenges"
-- These serve different purposes but can be consolidated into one comprehensive policy
-- that covers both use cases without losing functionality

-- Drop the individual policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read their own answers" ON answers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Challenge participants can see all answers in their challenges" ON answers;

-- Create a comprehensive policy that covers both cases:
-- 1. Users can see their own answers (anywhere)
-- 2. Users can see all answers in challenges they participate in
CREATE POLICY "Users can view answers they have access to" ON answers
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  -- Case 1: User can see their own answers
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id 
  OR 
  -- Case 2: User can see all answers in challenges they participate in
  challenge_id IN (
    SELECT challenges.challenge_id
    FROM challenges
    WHERE ((select auth.uid()) = challenges.challenger_id) 
       OR ((select auth.uid()) = challenges.opponent_id)
  )
);

-- VALIDATION QUERY
-- ===============================================

-- Check that we now have only one policy per table/role/action combination
SELECT 
  tablename,
  cmd as action,
  roles,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count,
  string_agg(policyname, ', ' ORDER BY policyname) as policy_names
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('friend_requests', 'answers')
GROUP BY tablename, cmd, roles
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1  -- Only show if there are still multiple policies
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;

-- If the above query returns no rows, all duplicate policies have been resolved!

-- ===============================================
-- COMPREHENSIVE POLICY OVERVIEW
-- ===============================================

-- Show all remaining policies after final consolidation
SELECT

-- COMPLETION STATUS
-- ===============================================

SELECT
